# MarvelChallenge

This is my solution for an iOS app that lists all the marvel characters and what comics they appear in.

## Setup
#### Clone the project
Run  `$ git clone https://github.com/gaabrielmocelin/MarvelChallenge.git`

#### Install dependencies
Run `$ pod install`

### Resources
[Marvel API](https://developer.marvel.com/documentation/getting_started) - used to fetch all the characteres data and images .\
[Alamofire](https://www.github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire) - used to avoid boilerplate code on performing http request and also handle image cache.\
[Crypto Swift](https://github.com/krzyzanowskim/CryptoSwift) - used to generate the hash necessary to authenticate the http request on Marvel API.
